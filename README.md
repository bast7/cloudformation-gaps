# Cloudformation Gaps
Project to track CloudFormation Coverage.

**This project isn't tracked by AWS.** You can add üëç to an issue to show you're having the same problem, but the only way to add weight is to **open a feature request via support or your account team** (if you have access to either of those).

see https://github.com/cfntools/cloudformation-gaps/projects/1

## Project Columns
- Found: A gap in cloudformation coverage has been identified
- Reported: Someone opened a support case to report the issue to AWS
- Publicly Acknowledged: An AWS Employee (eg @AWSSupport on twitter) has acknowledge that they are aware of the issue
- Released: The GAP is gone
